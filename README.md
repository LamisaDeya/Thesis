# Abstractive Summarization of Bengali Academic Videos Based on Audio Subtitles

## Supervisor:
**Abdul Aziz**, Assistant Professor, Department of CSE, Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET)

## Overview
This research introduces the first end-to-end system for abstractive summarization of Bengali academic videos. It fine-tunes BanglaT5 and mT5-multilingual-XLSum models using two benchmark datasets (10,029 text-summary pairs and 1,005 summary-title pairs). The generated summaries are compared using different models using ROUGE, BERT, Mover scores, and factual consistency scores. The system integrates audio preprocessing, transcription, smart chunking, summarization, title generation, and timestamp mapping to enhance accessibility of Bengali educational content.

## Objectives
- Develop an efficient Bangla video summarization system.
- Create a benchmark dataset for Bangla video summarization.
- Generate concise summaries of lengthy videos.
- Enable users to quickly identify relevant video content.
- Enhance existing Bangla summarization approaches.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Dataset Collection
- Collection of Bangla articles and summaries, incorporating **19,096 data points** for abstractive summarization and additional manually collected summaries.

### 2. Model Design
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Using **Bangla-T5** for capturing contextual information.
- **Extractive Summarization**: Utilizing **Bangla-BERTSum** for extracting key sentences.
- **Proposed Methodology**: Combining abstractive summarization followed by extractive summarization for generating coherent and concise summaries.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing
- **Audio Extraction**: Using MoviePy for extracting audio.
- **Speech Recognition**: Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API.
- **Text Cleaning**: DeepPunct model for punctuation and stop word removal.

### 2. Model Design
- **Bangla-T5**:
  - Sequence-to-sequence model for abstractive summarization.
  - Trained on the Bangla2B+ dataset.
- **Bangla-BERTSum**:
  - Extractive summarization model based on Bangla-BERT.
  - Capable of handling multiple sentences and generating summaries using attention scoring.

### 3. Sequential Summarization
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates contextually rich summaries.
- **Extractive Summarization**: Filters key sentences for brevity and relevance.

## Results

### Quantitative Results
A table of metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of both models in summarizing Bangla video content.

### Qualitative Results
Example summaries showcasing the coherence and accuracy of the generated summaries.

## Conclusion
- Developed a dual-model approach for Bangla video summarization using both **Bangla-T5** and **Bangla-BERTSum**.
- Created a benchmark dataset and fine-tuned models for Bangla-specific summarization tasks.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of a sequential abstractive-extractive approach.
